# Introduction

`Kuid` serves as a versatile application for managing two distinct categories of resources: `inventory` and `identifiers`. The inventory category encompasses resources spanning physical, virtual, and containerized environments, providing users with comprehensive visibility into their infrastructure assets. On the other hand, identifiers such as IP Address Management (IPAM), VLANs, Autonomous Systems, etc facilitate the precise identification and allocation of resources within the environment.
