# LinkSet

A `linkSet` in `kuid` represents a set of links that belong together within a node group or accross nodeGroups. E.g. it can be used to model a logical Link Aggregation group between 2 nodes or it can be used to represent a logical multi-homing construction between a set of nodes belonging to 1 or multiple nodeGroups/Topologies.
