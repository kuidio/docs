# EndpointSet

A `endpointSet` in `kuid` represents a set of endpoints that belong together within a nodeGroup. E.g. it can be used to model a logical Link Aggregation group within a node or it can be used to represent a logical multi-homing construction between a set of nodes belonging to a single nodeGroup.
