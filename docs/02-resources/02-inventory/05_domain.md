# AdminDomain

In Kuid, an `AdminDomain` represents a logical grouping of infrastructure resources managed by a single administrative entity or organization. `AdminDomains` serve as administrative boundaries within the environment, providing a structured framework for organizing and managing resources based on administrative ownership or responsibility.

Each `AdminDomain` encapsulates a set of components, such as nodes, modesets, and other relevant resources, that are administered and maintained by a designated administrative team or department. This hierarchical organization allows for centralized management and control of resources, facilitating efficient allocation, monitoring, and maintenance of assets.
