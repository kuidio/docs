# Rack

In Kuid, the rack model represents a physical equipment rack within your environment. Each rack is designed to accommodate the installation of devices and equipment, providing a structured framework for organizing and managing hardware components. Racks are typically associated with a specific site and may optionally be assigned to a location within that site, offering flexibility in resource allocation and management.
