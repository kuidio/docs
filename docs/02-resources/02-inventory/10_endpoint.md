# Endpoint

In `Kuid`, an `Endpoint` represents a communication interface or connection point within a Node, facilitating network communication and data transfer between different components or systems within the environment. `Endpoints` serve as gateways for transmitting and receiving data, enabling seamless communication between `Nodes`.

!!!note "A `node` equipped with a set of `endpoints` resources might suffice as resources to model a fixed format entity. Conversely, modular systems often require the use of additional resources such as `NodeItems` and `ModuleBays`/`Module(s)` to accommodate their flexible configurations."
